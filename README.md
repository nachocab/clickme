# clickme

**clickme** is an R package that lets you plot your R data as interactive JavaScript visualizations.

[D3.js][] or [Raphaël.js][] are two visualization libraries that can be used generate powerful interactive plots that run on the browser. Unfortunately, they are hard to access within R. The design goal of **clickme** is to make JS visualizations as easy to use as the base `plot()` function.

The variables used in JS visualizations are statically-defined, which makes them hard to customize. Instead of using static JS files, clickme uses **ractives** (short for *interactives*—a hat tip to [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age)), which are simple folder structures that contain a template file and some configuration options. This approach makes it easy to specify what input data will be used by the JS code, it improves reusability, and encourages sharing.

## Quick Usage

You can install clickme by running this in your R session:

```S
install.packages("devtools") # In case you don't have it already installed

library(devtools)
install_github("clickme", "nachocab")
```

Other packages you might need include [rjson][] and a new version of [knitr][]

```S
install.packages("rjson")
install.packages("knitr", repos = "http://www.rforge.net/", type = "source")
```

Now you can try the examples.

Your browser will open a new tab for each example. The first one should look something like [this](http://bl.ocks.org/nachocab/5178583).

```S
library(clickme)

# visualize a force-directed interactive graph
items <- paste0("GENE_", 1:40)
n <- 30
df1 <- data.frame(a=sample(items, n, replace=TRUE), b=sample(items, n, replace=TRUE), type=sample(letters[1:3], n, replace=TRUE))
clickme(df1, "force_directed")

# visualize a line plot that allows zooming along the x-axis
n <- 30
cities <- c("Boston", "NYC", "Philadelphia")
df2 <- data.frame(name=rep(cities, each=n), x=rep(1:n,length(cities)), y=c(sort(rnorm(n)),-sort(rnorm(n)),sort(rnorm(n))))
clickme(df2, "line_with_focus")

# visualize an interactive heatmap alongside a parallel coordinates plot
rownames(df3) <- paste0("GENE_", 1:25)
colnames(df3) <- paste0("sample_", 1:8)
clickme(df3, "longitudinal_heatmap") # you will need to have a local server running for this example to work
```

## Acknowledgements
Thank you **Mike Bostock** for creating the [D3.js][] library. Being able to use it more effectively is the main reason why I developed clickme.

Thank you **Yihui Xie** for building the [knitr][] R package. Even though clickme only uses knitr as a templating engine, it is the most important part of my daily workflow.

## Contributing
If you can see the potential of clickme as a bridge between the R and JS worlds, please contribute by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/nachocab/clickme/issues), improving the source code or making your ractives publicly available.
